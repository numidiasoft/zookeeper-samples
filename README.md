# zookeeper-samples
A collection of zookeeper samples (Locker, leader, watching etc..)

ZooKeeper is an open source Apacheâ„¢ project that provides a centralized infrastructure and services that enable synchronization across a cluster. ZooKeeper maintains common objects needed in large cluster environments. Examples of these objects include configuration information, hierarchical naming space, and so on. Applications can leverage these services to coordinate distributed processing across large clusters.
